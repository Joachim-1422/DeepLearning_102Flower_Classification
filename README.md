**Flower Classification**

In this notebook, we will see how to use Transfer Learning for Image Classification based on the 102flower challenge.
First "Baseline Model" is completely useless. I just wanted a pytorch demonstration for the class model creation since after the transfer learning we will create somme fully connected layer.

In the end I achieve around 95% of accuracy for flower class detection.
Everything else should be explained in the notebook.
